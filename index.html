				<h2>What to call it?</h2>
				<p>Svalbard is an archipelago of islands in the European Arctic</p>
				<p>Svalbard and Spitsbergen are used interchangeably, though officially Svalbard refers to the archipelago and Spitsbergen the largest island</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Where is it?</h2>
				<p>1,000km north of the Norwegian North cape</p>
				<p>1/500km south of the North pole</p>
				<p>Comprises nine main islands and countless smaller islets</p>

				<h2>Geology</h2>
				<p>For most of Earth's history, Svalbard has been submerged, and probably formed close to the south pole</p>
				<p>The lack of soil or vegetation makes it a mecca for Geologists, as when not covered by ice, the entire geological range is visible.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="./images/Prins-karls-forrland.jpg" class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:300px !important">Cambrian</h2>
				<aside class="notes">The oldest rocks are found on the west and north coasts and comprise heavily metamorphosed precambrian bedrocks overlain by cambrian and ordovician limestones containing marine fossiles</aside>

				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:300px !important">Silurian &rarr; Devonian</h2>
				<aside class="notes">In the Silurian, two continental plates collided, and Svalbard was close to the equator. The rocks of this period are granites and form the characteristic pointed peaks of the west coast. In the Devonian period Svalbard spent some time out of the water, just north of the equator. Fossils of primitive fish and plants have been found from this period, and the rocks are a red sandstone, indicating a dry desert climate.</aside>

				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:300px !important">Jurassic &rarr; Cretaceous</h2>
				<aside class="notes">When what would become the Atlantic Ocean was formed in the cretaceous, Svalbard was drifting north, and getting wetter and more tropical. The coal seams so important for mining were initially formed during this period and contain plant fossils indicating a swamp-like climate. Throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods Svalbard drifted to around 65° North, roughly Iceland's latitude. It was predominantly marine, comprising sedimentary rocks such as marine shales. Fossils of reptiles such as Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur have been found.</aside>

				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:300px !important">Tertiary</h2>
				<aside class="notes">At the beginning of the Tertiary, Svalbard collided with Greenland causing intense folding of the Western strata and the formation of a basin or depression to the east, which dominates the geology of the South and Central parts of the archipelago. As a result of continued northwards drift and global cooling, Svalbard's climate became closer to that experienced today. As plate pressure diminished volcanic activity occurred, indicated by basalt flows in the north.</aside>

				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:100px !important">Present: West Coast</h2>
				<aside class="notes">The present landscape is mostly caused by repeated periods of glaciation since the onset of the Quarternary period 3 million years ago. There have been at least 50 visible periods of glaciation, the last of which occurred in the Little Ice Age. Unlike the rest of Europe, this did not officially finish on Svalbard until the earlier 20th Century!</aside>

				<small class="attribution" style="color:black">Jo</small>

			<section>
				<h2>Climate</h2>
				<p>Svalbard is high-arctic with a polar desert climate. This means relatively little precipitation of any kind.</p>
				<p>The West coast is warmed by the gulf stream and has a slightly damper, warmer climate than the east, which has a dry steppe-like climate.</p>
				<p>Mean temperatures range from -16°C in Winter to +6°C in Summer, but with highs of +21 and lows of -45 not uncommon.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Vegetation</h2>
				<img src="./images/figur_5.jpg" class="center">
				<aside class="notes">Over 60% of the land area is glaciated (white in the picture), 30% is barren ground such as rock, scree and moraines (grey and pale blue), and the remaining 10% is vegetated. There is almost continuous permafrost, up to 500m deep across the entire archipelago.</aside>

			<section data-background-image="./images/Svalbard-snow-storm-and-avalanche-8.jpg"  class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:100px !important">Climate Change</h2>
				<aside class="notes">An increase in the depth of permafrost that melts in the warm summer temperatures is causing increased instability, in the form of landslides, flooding and avalanches. Avalanches in 2015 and 2016 killed several people in Longyearbyen and destroyed houses and cars. This is also causing problems for the wildlife, with polar bears finding it difficult to get food, and arctic fox burrows collapsing</aside>
			</section>


			<section data-background-image="./images/reindeer2.JPG" class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:100px !important">Wildlife</h2>
				<aside class="notes">We saw plenty of reindeer. These are a sub-species that have evolved independently since the last Ice Age.</p>
				<p>Compared to their other Northern European relatives they have much shorter legs and are plumper, and are fully wild. Arctic fox are also common, but we only saw footprints. Whales, Seals and walruses are frequent Summer residents, with sightings possible all around the coasts.</aside>

				<img src="./images/polarbear.jpg" class="center" width="400">
				<aside class="notes">Svalbard is known for having more resident polar bears than people, but we didn't see any (live ones)!</aside>

			<section data-background-image="./images/ptarmigan.JPG" class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment" style="color:black;margin-top:400px !important">Birds</h2>
				<aside class="notes">There are approximately 130 species of birds in Svalbard. Most are migratory
				Summer visitors include Guillemots, Puffins, Geese, Gulls and Terns, with Snow Buntings and Sand Pipers inland. The only bird to over-winter in the archipelago is the Ptarmigan. We saw footprints, but no other evidence. Our guide told us that they are regularly hunted, and so stupid that you can shoot one bird in a flock and the others will just keep on eating.</aside>
				<small class="attribution" style="color:black">Barry</small>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Insects</h2>
				<p>Compared to mammals and birds, the insect species of Svalbard are diverse, with over 1000 recorded species. They tend to be concentrated where there is some vegetation and soil, and are found primarily on the warmer west coast. Notable omissions are bee species- flowers rely on flies or self-pollination</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Vegetation</h2>
				<p>Higher plant species are concentrated mainly in the west and the central basin. Despite the steppe-like climate, what groundwater there is can be found in the top soil layers, above the permafrost, so in the summer months quite a few plants grow.</p>
				<p>The lack of pollinating insects mean most plants reproduce using suckers. There's virtually no pollen on Svalbard!</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Summer</h2>
				<img src="./images/fixedw_large_4x.jpg" class="center" width="600">
				<aside class="notes">In the summer months, large areas are covered by cotton grass.</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Trees</h2>
				<img src="./images/Svalbard2008 - 294.JPG" class="center" width="600">
				<aside class="notes">Trees such as Arctic Willow grow to no more than 5cm tall.</aside>

				<h2>Flowering Plants</h2>
				<img src="./images/saxiphrage.JPG" class="center" width="500">
				<aside class="notes">On the East coast, saxiphraga hangs on.</aside>
				<small class="attribution">Barry</small>

			<section>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Svalbard has no indigenous population and no evidence of human occupation has been discovered prior to the 16th century.</p>
				<p>Having said that, the milder prehistoric climate suggests a pre Stone-Age population is not out of the question and may still be waiting for be discovered. Similarly documentary evidence from the 12th century suggests the Vikings knew of the islands but no definitive evidence has yet been found.</p>
			</section>

			<section data-background-image="./images/Barentsz_Full_Map.jpg" class="full">
				<aside class="notes">Willem Barentsz, the Dutch explorer, landed on Spitsbergen in 1596, in his third voyage to try to find the North-East passage. The first definitive occuptation of Svalbard was by seasonal Dutch whalers and trappers in the 16th century, although there is some archaeological evidence in the Russian settlement of Barentsburg that Pomor, or "Sea People" commercially hunted, and over-wintered there earlier.</aside>

			<section data-background-image="./images/Svalbard2008-181.JPG" class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment">Whaling</h2>
				<aside class="notes">Although the peak period for whaling was the 17th century, it continued beyond that and evidence is still visible throughout the archipelago.</aside>

			<section data-background-image="./images/IMG_1152.JPG" data-background-position="center" class="full">
				<h2 class="fragment">Mining</h2>
				<aside class="notes">From the end of the 19th century Svalbard gained importance for its mineral deposits- mainly coal but also Copper, Gypsum, Aspestos, Lead, Iron, Marble and Gold. Only coal mining was relatively successful, and provided the archipelago with strategic importance during World War One.. Historical remains from the mining industry are prevalent around Longyearbyen.</aside>

			<section>
				<h2>Svalbard Today</h2>
				<p>The Svalbard Treaty, signed in 1925 with now over 50 countries as signatories, formalises the legal status of the archipelago as Norwegian territory.</p>
				<p>Permanent military installations are strictly forbidden. The only taxes that can be claimed are those that go towards the administration of the archipelago, and all citizens of all treaty nations must be treated equally</p>
				<aside class="notes">
				Residents of Svalbard must be physically, mentally and financially able to look after themselves. The infirm, or even heavily pregnant, are sent back to mainland Norway for treatment and care.

			<section data-background-image="./images/P3190108.JPG" data-background-position="center" class="full">
				<aside class="notes">Longyearbyen is the largest settlement, with a population of 2,200 (2017). About 50% are between 20 and 44 years of age, gender is fairly balanced, and about 25% of residents are from outside Norway.</aside>

				<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Svalbard is really, really cold in the Winter!</p>
				<p class="fragment">The polar bear risk limits what independent travelling you can do.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Having said that, as a place to visit the high arctic, it's pretty easy to get to, and definitely worth a short trip.</p>
